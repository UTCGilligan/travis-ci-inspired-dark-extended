## About

This project started to give Travis CI a dark style, but it soon became apparent that some other sites coverage was needed. So the Extended version was sort of started.

I drew some inspiration by [StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark) and the idea is to transition smoothly from GitHub Dark to other associated projects used sometimes.

At launch A total of 7 sites are covered either partially or fully.
There are limitations on a opensource free project to provide full coverage.

if you would like to contribute, please keep reading.

Have fun and save the corneas :smile:
