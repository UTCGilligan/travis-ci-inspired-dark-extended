## About

This project started to give Travis CI a dark style, but it soon became apparent that some other sites coverage was needed. So the Extended version was sort of started instead.

I drew some inspiration by [StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark) and the idea is to transition smoothly from GitHub Dark to other associated projects used sometimes.

At launch, a total of 7 sites are covered either partially or fully.
There are some limitations on a opensource free project account to provide :asterisk: full coverage.

if you would like to contribute, please keep reading.

Have fun and save the corneas :smile:
